        <div>
            <p>The Berlin Techs community is filled with amazing, clever and creative people, and we're excited for you to join us. Our goal is to create spaces where people can gather and discuss important themes and feelings that many of us will experience during our careers.</p>
            <h2 id="being-a-good-community-member">Being a Good Community Member</h2>
            <p>Because we prioritize creating a safe space for our members, we believe in actively working on how we, as individuals, can ensure a positive community environment through our own actions and mindsets.</p>
            <p>Every supportive community starts with each member. We feel it's important to be open to others, respectful, and supportive. As part of the Berlin Techs community, please begin by thinking carefully about and agreeing with the following statements:</p>
            <ul>
            <li>I will be welcoming to everyone at the table;</li>
            <li>I will be patient and open to learning from everyone around me;</li>
            <li>I will treat everyone with respect, because they deserve it;</li>
            <li>I will be mindful of the needs and boundaries of others;</li>
            </ul>
            <p>We strive to create a space where we learn and grow together. Here are some other key things you can do to make the community great:</p>
            <h3 id="be-humble">Be Humble</h3>
            <p>People come from all different places, and it’s best not to make assumptions about what they think or feel. Approach others with curiosity and openness. We all have a lot to learn from each other.</p>
            <h3 id="be-helpful-when-asked">Be Helpful When Asked</h3>
            <p>If someone asks for help, consider jumping in. You don’t have to be an expert to talk through a problem, suggest a resource, or help find a solution. We all have something to contribute.</p>
            <h3 id="encourage-others">Encourage Others</h3>
            <p>There’s no one path to have a career in technology or to this community. Let’s engage others in ways that create opportunities for learning and fun for all of us.</p>
            <h2 id="our-pledge">Our Pledge</h2>
            <p>Everyone who participates in our community must agree to abide by our Code of Conduct. By agreeing, you help create a welcoming, respectful, and friendly community based on respect and trust. We are committed to creating a harassment-free community.</p>
            <p>These rules will be strictly enforced in any and all of our official spaces, including direct messages, social media, and physical and virtual events. Everyone who participates in these spaces is required to agree to this code. We also ask and expect community members to observe these rules anywhere the community is meeting (for example, online chats on unofficial platforms or event after-parties).</p>
            <h2 id="our-standards">Our Standards</h2>
            <h3 id="public-first">Public First, Private with Consent</h3>
            <p>To ensure the maximum benefit for the community, keep conversations in public channels and threads. Do not send private messages within the server without first asking the recipient in a public space and having an explicit approval.</p>
            <h3 id="be-respectful">Be Respectful</h3>
            <p>Exercise consideration and respect in your speech and actions. Be willing to accept and give feedback gracefully.</p>
            <p>Don’t make offensive comments related to gender, gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, disability, mental illness, neuro(a)typicality, physical appearance, body size, race, ethnicity, immigration status, religion, experience level, socioeconomic status, nationality, or other identity markers.</p>
            <p>Additionally, don’t insult or demean others. This includes making unwelcome comments about a person’s lifestyle choices and practices, including things related to diet, health, parenting, drugs, or employment. It’s not okay to insult or demean others if it’s &quot;just a joke.&quot;</p>
            <h3 id="be-welcoming-and-open">Be Welcoming and Open</h3>
            <p>Encourage others, be supportive and willing to listen, and be willing to learn from others’ perspectives and experiences. Lead with empathy and kindness.</p>
            <p>Don’t engage in gatekeeping behaviors, like questioning the intelligence or knowledge of others as a way to prove their credentials. And don’t exclude people for prejudicial reasons.</p>
            <h3 id="respect-privacy">Respect Privacy</h3>
            <p>Do not publish private communications without consent. Additionally, never disclose private aspects of a person’s personal identity without consent, except as necessary to protect them from intentional abuse.</p>
            <h3 id="respect-personal-identity">Respect Personal Identity</h3>
            <p>Use people’s correct pronouns. Do not deliberately misgender others or use “dead” or rejected names. Additionally, we ask that you approach matters of personal identity with joy: please be proactive in asking how others prefer to be identified if you are unsure, and accept their identity with enthusiasm.</p>
            <h3 id="respect-personal-boundaries">Respect Personal Boundaries</h3>
            <p>Do not introduce gratuitous or off-topic sexual images, languages, or behavior in spaces where they are not appropriate. Never make physical contact or simulated physical contact without consent or after a request to stop. Additionally, do not continue to message others about anything if they ask you to stop or leave them alone.</p>
            <h3 id="be-a-good-neighbor">Be a Good Neighbor</h3>
            <p>Contribute to the community in a positive and thoughtful way. Consider what’s best for the overall community. Do not make threats of violence, intimidate others, incite violence or intimidation against others, incite self-harm, stalk, follow, or otherwise harass others. Be mindful of your surroundings and of your fellow participants.</p>
            <p>Alert community leaders if you notice a dangerous situation, someone in distress, or violations of this Code of Conduct, even if they seem inconsequential.</p>
            <h2 id="additional-rules-for-online-spaces">Additional rules for online spaces</h2>
            <p>For Berlin Techs' official online spaces, like our community Discord channel, we have some additional rules. Any of the following behaviors can result in a ban without warning.</p>
            <h3 id="berlin-specific">Only post links that are relevant to both Berlin and tech.</h3>
            <p>There are many online spaces that exist to share links that are either not Berlin-specific or tech-specific. General converstaion is fine, but when using the server to promote a project, job, event, or cause - keep it specific.</p>
            <h3 id="don-t-spam">Don&#39;t Spam</h3>
            <p>Don&#39;t spam. We&#39;ll ban you. This includes in DMs. See: <a href="#public-first">Public First, Private with Consent</a>.</p>
            <h3 id="keep-it-legal">Keep It Legal</h3>
            <p>If it’s illegal, it’s not allowed on our websites or in our online spaces. Please don’t share links to pirated material or other nefarious things.</p>
            <h3 id="no-trolling">No Trolling</h3>
            <p>Please be earnest. Don’t use excessive sarcasm to annoy or undermine other people. And don’t bait them with bad faith comments or abuse.</p>
            <h3 id="pornography-and-other-nsfw-stuff">Pornography and Other NSFW Stuff</h3>
            <p>Please don’t post it or link to it. We’re not against NSFW content, but it doesn’t belong in our online spaces.</p>
            <h3 id="foul-and-graphic-language">Foul and Graphic Language</h3>
            <p>Please do not use excessive curse words. Additionally, do not use graphic sexual or violent language — again, think of our spaces as places for people of all ages.</p>
            <h2 id="reporting">Reporting</h2>
            <p>If you are being harassed by a member of the Berlin Techs community, or if you observe someone else being harassed, please report the behavior to a community leader.</p>
            <h2 id="enforcement-reporting">Enforcement &amp; Reporting</h2>
            <p>If you are being harassed by a member of the Berlin Techs community, if you observe someone else being harassed, or you experience actions or behaviors that are contrary to our Code of Conduct, please report the behavior to a community leader.</p>
            <p>Community leaders will follow these Community Impact Guidelines in determining the consequences for any action they deem in violation of this Code of Conduct:</p>
